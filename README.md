# FTCSEM
A FORTRAN-based frequency- and time-domain CSEM forward modeling and inversion program for arbitrary electrical  sources in a 1D layered Earth
The FTCSEM can perform 1D forward modeling and inversion calculations for most currently available CSEM device types. 
The operation of the executable program can follow the page prompt, easy to execute.
We have attached a test model  file (TESTMODEL.TXT) on which users can modify the model parameters.
